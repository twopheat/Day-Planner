# Day-Planner
This is a Simple Day Planner, it keeps notes for each hour of your work day, regardless of cache/browser/cookies state.

"AS AN employee with a busy schedule

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively "

I worked very hard on this one, as I am learning JS and jquery, I feel I made some serious breakthroughs.
I had a hard time getting momemt.js to help me change the colors of my fields, but other than that, it seemed to work out.
